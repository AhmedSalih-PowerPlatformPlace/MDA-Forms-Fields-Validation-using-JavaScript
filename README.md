# MDA-Forms-Fields-Validation-using-JavaScript

1.	Download the Managed Solution: Download the managed solution package file. This file should typically be in a .zip format and will contain the components of the solution, including the Canvas PowerApp.
2.	Access Your Dev Environment: Log into your Microsoft Power Apps account and switch to your Dev environment. You can switch the environment by clicking on the current environment name at the top right corner and selecting the target Dev environment from the drop-down list.
3.	Import the Managed Solution: In your Dev environment, navigate to the 'Solutions' area, which is usually located in the left navigation pane. Here, you will find an 'Import' button at the top - click on it. Then, you'll be asked to browse for the managed solution .zip file you've downloaded. Find and select it, then click 'Next'.
4.	Open the Model-Driven App: After importing the solution, navigate to the Apps section and open your Model-Driven App.
5.	Test Field Validation: Create a new record within your app to test the field validation. This is done by filling out the forms and ensuring that the validation rules, if any, are working correctly.
6.	Generate JavaScript Code: Switch over to the Canvas App. On the customer page, input your requirements to generate JavaScript code for your complex validations.
7.	Copy and Save the Code: Once the JavaScript code is generated, copy the code and open Visual Studio Code or your preferred text editor. Paste the code into a new file and save it with a .js extension.
8.	Create a Web Resource: Inside the solution, Create New and select web resource. In the form, provide a name, choose 'Script (JScript)' as the type, and upload the JavaScript file you saved earlier.
9.	Link to OnChange Event: Now, go to the form where you want this validation to apply. Select the field and navigate to its 'Events' tab. In the 'Event Handlers' section, add a new event handler. Choose 'Web Resource' as the library, select your newly created web resource, and set the event to 'OnChange'. This will trigger your custom validation whenever the field value is changed.
10.	Test and Save: Save and publish your changes, then create a new record or update an existing one to test the new JavaScript validation.

As always, please remember that these are general instructions, and some steps may vary based on the specifics of your app and environment. Always refer to the app's documentation or seek assistance when needed.
